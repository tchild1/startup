# Startup Application

## Elevator Pitch
Have you ever wanted to eat healthier? Have you struggled to keep track of your recepies? Or do you feel like you eat the same thing every day/week?

PlanMyMeals is an app that assists you in overcoming all these problems. PlanMyMeals stores all of your receipies to a database, and then periodically reccomends them to you as you get on the app to plan you meals every week. PlanMyMeals tracks what you want to eat every week and will create a shopping list of all the items you will need to buy before you make those meals. This app will alleiviate the headache of remembering meal options and compiling a shopping list accordingly.

# What Am I Learning?
The deployment script:
./deployFiles.sh -k ~/CS260/TannerChildKey.pem -h tannerchild.com -s simon

First, I became much more comfortable using git and github to
- Create a repository on GitHub
- Clone that repository to my computer
- Add, Stage, and Push changes to that repository on GitHub

I learned that when writing HTML it is very useful to use the table tag to make rows of text/items rather than trying to line up divs next to each other.

I now realize that when I wrote (very) basic HTML for another class, I was trying to do too much styling/centering/formating using HTML. It makes much more sense to do it this way, where we have a very clear structure in HTML and will style it when we apply CSS.

I learned how to use LiveServer to view my HTML as I edited it :) That was really nice.

Finally, I realized that I had an error in the deployment script filepath that didn't allow me to deploy my changes to the site. I was able ti fix this and resolve the error.
