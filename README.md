# startup
Startup Application for CS 260

In doing this assignment I learned so much. 

I now feel that I understand the basics of git and github. 
I understand that with these tools you can keep previous versions of your code, and have multiple people making edits to the same repsoitory, at the same time, while not ruining anything. (As long as you are careful to resolve conflicts.)
I understand that when you start, you should do a git pull, to get all the changes from the main branch on your computer.
Then as you make changes you periodicaly do git commit and push to save those changes on github. 

Also, you should ALWAYS leave good notes as you commit!!! :)
