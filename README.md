# Startup Application

## Elevator Pitch
Have you ever wanted to eat healthier? Have you struggled to keep track of your recepies? Or do you feel like you eat the same thing every day/week?

PlanMyMeals is an app that assists you in overcoming all these problems. PlanMyMeals stores all of your receipies to a database, and then periodically reccomends them to you as you get on the app to plan you meals every week. PlanMyMeals tracks what you want to eat every week and will create a shopping list of all the items you will need to buy before you make those meals. This app will alleiviate the headache of remembering meal options and compiling a shopping list accordingly.

# What Am I Learning?
The deployment script:
./deployFiles.sh -k ~/CS260/TannerChildKey.pem -h tannerchild.com -s simon

First, I became much more comfortable using git and github to
- Create a repository on GitHub
- Clone that repository to my computer
- Add, Stage, and Push changes to that repository on GitHub

I learned that when writing HTML it is very useful to use the table tag to make rows of text/items rather than trying to line up divs next to each other.

I now realize that when I wrote (very) basic HTML for another class, I was trying to do too much styling/centering/formating using HTML. It makes much more sense to do it this way, where we have a very clear structure in HTML and will style it when we apply CSS.

I learned how to use LiveServer to view my HTML as I edited it :) That was really nice.

Finally, I realized that I had an error in the deployment script filepath that didn't allow me to deploy my changes to the site. I was able ti fix this and resolve the error.


As I have applied CSS to my Startup application and my Simon application, I have learned so much about how CSS works. 
- Very importantly, I became familiar with how one bit of CSS can overwrite another. That is important if you want to overwrite a piece, you have to be aware of where you are putting it
- I also have become very comfortable with media queries. These are very important so that my web page can be displayed on both desktop and mobile. 
- As I have been practicing more with CSS, I have also become much better at debugging issues. If something isn't displaying as I had been expecting, I am now very comfortable using the chrome debugger to see where the issue might be.
